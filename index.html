        <p>My name is Mallory Sheehan and I'm 33 years old, living in Los Angeles, California. I'm originally from New Jersey and I graduated from Penn State University in 2011. I started my career at CBS Radio in New York selling local radio advertisements on 1010 WINS and WFAN, as well as homepage takeovers and banners on cbsnewyork.com. I developed an interest in digital advertising, so after CBS, I spent a year selling in-app advertising at Jun Group and most recently, I spent 4 1/2 years at AnyClip selling their proprietary A.I. video technology to digital publishers and media companies.
